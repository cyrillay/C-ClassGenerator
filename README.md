# C-ClassGenerator
I developped this software to get familiar with C++ and especially the GUI framework Qt. This GUI aims to generate the basic code structure of a C++ class.


One user can set different parameters such as the class name, comments, eventual inheritance, protection against multi-inclusion of header files, etc.
Then, simply generate the code and copy paste it into your favorite IDE. 

Below is a screenshot of the application running :
